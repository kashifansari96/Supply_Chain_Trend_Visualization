# Supply Chain Trend Visualization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on visualizing trends in supply chain data. The analysis includes checking for missing values, grouping data by location, exploring transportation modes, calculating total revenue, analyzing product type distribution, examining price distribution, and investigating defect rates. Additionally, we compare shipping costs among three different carriers.

## Libraries Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Steps and Analysis
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**
   - Loaded the data into a DataFrame.
   - Checked for and handled missing (NA) values.

2. **Location-Wise Grouping**
   - Grouped the data based on location.
   - Visualized the grouped data using histograms and pie charts.

3. **Exploring Transportation Modes**
   - Investigated different modes of transport used in the supply chain.
   - Visualized the distribution of transportation modes.

4. **Revenue Analysis**
   - Calculated and explored total revenue.
   - Visualized revenue data using appropriate charts.

5. **Product Type Distribution**
   - Analyzed the distribution of product types: skincare, haircare, and cosmetics.
   - Visualized the product type distribution.

6. **Price Distribution Analysis**
   - Examined price distribution based on frequency.
   - Created visualizations to represent price distribution.

7. **Defect Rate Analysis**
   - Investigated defect rates for each product type.
   - Visualized the defect rates.

8. **Transportation Modes with Defects**
   - Analyzed the correlation between transportation modes and defect rates.
   - Visualized the findings.

9. **Shipping Cost Comparison**
   - Compared shipping costs among three carriers: Carrier A, Carrier B, and Carrier C.
   - Visualized the cost comparison.
